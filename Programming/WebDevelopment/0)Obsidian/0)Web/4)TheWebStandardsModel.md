# Web Standards
- **Web standards** are the technologies we use to build websites. These standards exist as long technical documents called specifications, which detail exactly how the technology should work. 
- These documents are not very useful for learning how to use the technologies they describe, but instead are intended to be used by software engineers to implement these technologies (usually in web browsers).
- For example, the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) describes exactly how HTML (all the HTML elements, and their associated APIs, and other surrounding technologies) should be implemented.
- Web standards are created by standards bodies — institutions that invite groups of people from different technology companies to come together and agree on how the technologies should work in the best way to fulfill all of their use cases. 
- The W3C is the best known web standards body, but there are others such as the [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/) (who maintain the living standards for the HTML language), [ECMA](https://ecma-international.org/) (who publish the standard for ECMAScript, which JavaScript is based on), [Khronos](https://www.khronos.org/) (who publish technologies for 3D graphics, such as WebGL), and others.
### [Web standards key principles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards/The_web_standards_model#web_standards_key_principles)

- The basic principles of the web:
	- Open to contribute and use.
	- Not patent-encumbered or controlled by a single private entity.
	- Accessible and interoperable.
	- They don't break the web.
- This basis means that the web is a unique and exciting industry to get involved in.

### ["Open" standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards/The_web_standards_model#open_standards)

- One of the key aspects of web standards, which TimBL and the W3C agreed on from the start, is that the web (and web technologies) should be free to both contribute and use, and not encumbered by patents/licensing. 
- Therefore anyone can write the code to build a website for free, and anyone can contribute to the standards creation process, where the specs are written.
- Because web technologies are created openly, in collaboration between many different companies, it means that no one company gets to control them, which is a really good thing.
- You wouldn't want a single company suddenly deciding to put the entire web behind a paywall, or releasing a new version of HTML that everyone has to buy to continue making websites, or worse still, just deciding they aren't interested any more and just turning it off.
- This allows the web to remain a freely-available public resource.

### [Don't break the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards/The_web_standards_model#dont_break_the_web)

- Another phrase you'll hear around open web standards is "don't break the web" — the idea is that any new web technology that is introduced should be backwards compatible with what went before it (i.e. old websites will still continue to work), and forwards compatible (future technologies in turn will be compatible with what we currently have).
