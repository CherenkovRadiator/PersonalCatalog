# Number System
# Binary
This is the base two number system in which only two numbers exist. Computers are made of tiny switch that have only two state on or off (a.k.a. 1 or 0), hence, everything is represented with these two digits.
These are called binary values. A single binary value is call a bit, a group of 4 bits is called a nibble and a group of 8 bits is called a byte.
## ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
It is tedious for humans to read binary values directly and interpret what it means hence ASCII is used. ASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. It defines how a character is defined in binary.
## Unicode
Unicode is a super-set of ASCII, it defines 32 bit characters other than English alphabets, like characters for other languages or emojis etc. It is represented with `U+` before it in hex-decimal. Some characters are represented as a combination of two Unicode characters like different versions of same text or different colors of emojis.
# Representation
In the end all the data is in the form of 1's and 0's and it is up to the software/program or programmer to decide how those bits are represented be it image, text, numbers, sound etc.
# Algorithms
These are step by step instructions to solve a problem.
# Pseudocode
An implementation of code to be written in normal English that conveys the thoughts and steps of an algorithm.
