# Earth
- Shape of the earth is described as an Oblate Spheroid / Ellipsoid.
	- In Earth and Planetary science, oblate spheroid is described as the shape of Earth and many other planets that appears to be like a flattened sphere, a sphere that is flat from north and south poles. [[OblateSpheroid.PNG]]
	- Because earth is an oblate spheroid the Polar diameter (linear distance between North pole to South pole) is shorter than Equatorial diameter (Earth's diameter across equator's great circle).
	- Ellipsoid is a 3-dimensional ellipse. [[EllipseShape.jpg]]
- Earth's shape may also be referred to as a geoid.
	- The **geoid** is the shape that the ocean surface would take under the influence of the gravity of Earth, including gravitational attraction and Earth's rotation, if other influences such as winds and tides were absent. In measuring altitudes "sea level" refers to the surface of the geoid. [[Geoid.jpg]]
- There are multiple models of Earth but ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) has adopted WGS84 or World Geodetic System 1984 as standard earth model.
	- The World Geodetic System (WGS) is a standard used in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including GPS.
